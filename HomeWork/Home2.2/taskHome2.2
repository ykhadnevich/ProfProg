**TASK. Enhanced favorite colour program**

Let's use the set of requirements as class-2.2 task as a base.
For this homework we will add one more user's request:

As a user I want to be able to add unfavorite colour as an optional input to the program: that color should be changed to the favorite one. This will allow me to keep calm as the program will eliminate that horrible colour.

Your task is to implement corresponding implementation on your secondary programming language. Also you should extend your test suite from the class homework with few test cases related to the new scenarios from above.
