**TASK. Refactoring**

Refactor the code from MaybeTheBestCodeEver.cpp to:
- remove global variables;
- introduce classes to encapsulate some parts of logic;
- improve code quality;
- decrease the scope of variables;
- make this code clean;
- cover the refactored code with unit tests using UnitTests.hpp.
