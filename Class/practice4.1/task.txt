**TASK. Pizza builder time!**

We want to create a simple console application that prints a list of available ingredients to the user and allows to compose a unique pizza. When the user enters done - the program should print the ingredients and the cost of the pizza. Note that all available ingredients and their cost should be stored in a special text file with data.

Use TDD approach to cover all the introduced classes with unit tests. You should use Builder design pattern to implement the pizza creation logic.
