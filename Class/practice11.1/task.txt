**TASK. Book Recommendation**

We have a small library-like cafe that allows our customers to take any book during lunch. But usually it is a big problem of choice for them. We want to use a program that will randomly propose a book to our customer. The customer can decline the proposal and get a new recommendatiion as many times as he wants if he didn't like book. But if all books are not ok from him then our program should display "Adios amigo!" message and crash.
Here is the list of available books that can be proposed to the customer:
1. The Topographerâ€™s Clown.
2. The Chamber of Beaver.
3. The Ironer of Kanban.
4. The Piglet of Tire.
5. The Border of the Unix.
6. The Half-Time Convince.
7. The Earthly Pillows.
8. The Censorship of the Ping.
9. The True Powers.
10. The Overturn of the Ling.
